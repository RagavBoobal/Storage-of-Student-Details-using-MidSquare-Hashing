# Storage-of-Student-Details-using-MidSquare-Hashing

PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION :-
In arrays,the time taken to retreive and manipulate a particular data is more when compared to hash Table.So, we use mid-square method in Hashing Technique to store the data.

PROBLEM DEFINITION :-
By using Hash table technique, to store the student details and access them according to their register number's and sort them according to their attributes such as Name, register number, date of birth etc..,

OBJECTIVE :-
To reduce the time taken for manipulating the particular student record and reduce the time on searching and deleting.To reduce the storage space an memory consuption.

SCOPE :-
To develop a C++ program for student management system by storing the data in the HASH and applying merge sort for the student attributes.

METHODOLOGY :-
For storing, we use mid-square method in Hashing Technique.For sorting, we use merge sort method.
